public interface glGetGraphicsResetStatus {

/**
 * Indicates if the GL context has been in a reset state at any point since the last call to GetGraphicsResetStatus:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GLES20#GL_NO_ERROR NO_ERROR} indicates that the GL context has not been in a reset state since the last call.</li>
 * <li>{@link #GL_GUILTY_CONTEXT_RESET GUILTY_CONTEXT_RESET} indicates that a reset has been detected that is attributable to the current GL context.</li>
 * <li>{@link #GL_INNOCENT_CONTEXT_RESET INNOCENT_CONTEXT_RESET} indicates a reset has been detected that is not attributable to the current GL context.</li>
 * <li>{@link #GL_UNKNOWN_CONTEXT_RESET UNKNOWN_CONTEXT_RESET} indicates a detected graphics reset whose cause is unknown.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If a reset status other than NO_ERROR is returned and subsequent calls return NO_ERROR, the context reset was encountered and completed. If a reset
 * status is repeatedly returned, the context may be in the process of resetting.</p>
 *
 * <p>Reset notification behavior is determined at context creation time, and may be queried by calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constant
 * {@link #GL_RESET_NOTIFICATION_STRATEGY RESET_NOTIFICATION_STRATEGY}.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the reset notification behavior is {@link #GL_NO_RESET_NOTIFICATION NO_RESET_NOTIFICATION}, then the implementation will never deliver notification of reset events, and
 * GetGraphicsResetStatus will always return NO_ERROR.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the behavior is {@link #GL_LOSE_CONTEXT_ON_RESET LOSE_CONTEXT_ON_RESET}, a graphics reset will result in a lost context and require creating a new context as described
 * above. In this case GetGraphicsResetStatus will return an appropriate value from those described above.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a graphics reset notification occurs in a context, a notification must also occur in all other contexts which share objects with that context.</p>
 *
 * <p>After a graphics reset has occurred on a context, subsequent GL commands on that context (or any context which shares with that context) will generate a
 * {@link #GL_CONTEXT_LOST CONTEXT_LOST} error. Such commands will not have side effects (in particular, they will not modify memory passed by pointer for query results,
 * and may not block indefinitely or cause termination of the application. Exceptions to this behavior include:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GLES20#glGetError GetError} and GetGraphicsResetStatus behave normally following a graphics reset, so that the application can determine a reset has
 * occurred, and when it is safe to destroy and recreate the context.</li>
 * <li>Any commands which might cause a polling application to block indefinitely will generate a CONTEXT_LOST error, but will also return a value
 * indicating completion to the application.</li>
 * </ul>
