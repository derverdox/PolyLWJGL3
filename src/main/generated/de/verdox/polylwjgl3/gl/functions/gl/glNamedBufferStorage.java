/**
 * DSA version of {@link GL44C#glBufferStorage BufferStorage}.
 *
 * @param buffer the buffer object name
 * @param data   the address in client memory of the data that should be used to initialize the buffer's data store. If {@code data} is {@code NULL}, the data store of the
 *               buffer is created, but contains undefined data. Otherwise, {@code data} should point to an array of at least {@code size} basic machine units.
 * @param flags  the bitwise {@code OR} of flags describing the intended usage of the buffer object's data store by the application. Valid flags and their meanings

 *               argument may be used to specify the initial content of the buffer's data store regardless of the presence of the {@link GL44#GL_DYNAMIC_STORAGE_BIT DYNAMIC_STORAGE_BIT}.
 *               Regardless of the presence of this bit, buffers may always be updated with server-side calls such as {@link GL31C#glCopyBufferSubData CopyBufferSubData} and
 *               {@link GL43C#glClearBufferSubData ClearBufferSubData}.</li>
